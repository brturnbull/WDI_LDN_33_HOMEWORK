# Express - The Pair Programming Bot
## Introduction
> ***Note:*** _This can be a pair programming activity or done independently._
You are going to recreate the [Pair Programming Bot](http://pairprogrammingbot.herokuapp.com/) from scratch using Express, meaning each page will either have a 'YES/NO' option or a 'DONE' option, and each option will link to the appropriate page.
## Exercise
#### Requirements
- **Plan**: Draw a flow chart for the app's behaviour before you code a word. Check out [this flowchart example](https://c1.staticflickr.com/9/8160/7214525854_733237dd83_z.jpg) for flowchart inspiration.
- **ERB**: You should use EJS templates to keep your code DRY. Ask yourself what types of pages you will need a template for?
- **Instance Variables**: For each of the templates that you use, think about what information you will need to pass in using instance variables.
#### Bonus:
- **Style**: Styling is secondary, so don't start styling until your app works.
#### Deliverable
