# Beyond​ ​Front​ ​End​ ​Developer​ ​Task​

At Beyond we absolutely love working with the latest technologies and take great care in producing user friendly and aesthetically pleasing interfaces for our clients.

 Before we get you in for a chat, we would love to see you in action. As such, we have put together a small test for you to showcase your ninja coding skills.

For this task we would like you to build a simple app that consumes data from this [YouTube API JSON feed](https://www.googleapis.com/youtube/v3/playlistItems?part=snippet,contentDetails,status&maxResults=10&playlistId=PLSi28iDfECJPJYFA4wjlF5KUucFvc0qbQ&key=AIzaSyCuv_16onZRx3qHDStC-FUp__A6si-fStw) which is a list of videos that belong to a playlist.

 You should follow the design structure that has been shared with you. In the zip file you’ll find mocks of a possible look and feel, an assets folder and, if necessary, the original Sketch file used to create the design.

## Guidelines are as follows:

-	The site should be built using responsive techniques to behave well on a variety of devices
-	Layout should match the structure provided in the design guidelines.
-	Should behave accordingly cross browser.
-	Must be built using valid, accessible HTML, CSS and JavaScript
-	Work must be hosted on your GIT repository of choice (github, bitbucket etc.)
-	A running version of the test should be made available online (github pages, heroku etc.) 

As a developer we realise how busy you must be but, as we would like to see how you could take this task further, here are some suggestions:

-	The use of a build tool (webpack, gulp etc)
-	Tests (unit tests, e2e tests, etc)
-	Responsive Images
-	Animations / Transitions
-	Pagination
-	Production-ready optimisations
-	Anything else you can think of that would benefit this app

We really appreciate you dedicating your time to go through this exercise and hope to speak to you soon.
